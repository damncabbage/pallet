## Installation

To get started you'll need a working [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installation
(ideally set up to [install your global packages in your home directory](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md)). Once you have this, run:

```sh
$ npm install -g purescript pulp pallet
```

This installs the PureScript compiler (psc), the [Pulp](https://github.com/Bodil/pulp) build tool, and this package management tool.
